# Property Scrapper is a project I write to help me find my new home in France

## main goal
It's objective is mainly to scrap some property listing websites in France to look for new properties.
Currently with Covid19 it's getting very difficult to find a property as nobody sells their home. 
We are in the process of moving out and we are often arriving too late...

### features ideas
The idea is to look directly on the local real estate websites for new listings, and receive alerts as soon as they appears.
Maybe I can also get also a bit of de-duplication as many real-estate sites list the same property with different price.
Probably get an alert out of it.
Maybe I could add up some notes on top of the listing, or a flag so that I don't get an alert if it doesn't interest us.

### real objective
Many ideas, but the main goal is to code, refactor, test and train my skills on a personal project.
